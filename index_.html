<h2>Welcome to the Hybrid Learning Field Guide</h2>
<p class="drop-cap">Students are learning in a connected world. Universities are creating environments that are intended to support the academic use of digital technologies, whether online or on campus. Many lecturers are using digital technologies to augment, boost or extend their classes, units, modules, courses and programmes. </p>
<p>The landscape wherein hybrid  
learning is operationalised is uneven. There&apos;s no formula or silver bullet to pivot online,  launch an online programme, or adapt and improve an exisiting course. There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to digitization.</p>
<h3>The Hybrid Learning Field Guide</h3>
<p>The “field” for which the guide is created is higher education. Most of the “objects” within the guide are to be found at the nexus of seat and screen time. The guide offers digital visitors or residents who are course designers and developers a starting point, ideas to consider, practical activities to try and checklists for implementation.</p>
		<p>
The content of the guide is arranged across the eight dimensions (or panels). Within each of these panels, the guide offers bite sized suggestions to guide the enhancement and improvement of exisitng hybrid courses.</p>
<p>This field guide is based on a framework developed by the Department for Education Innovation at Pretoria University
</p>

    <li> <a href="support.html">Support Strategies</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Within each of the eight panels is a variety of digital education elements (tools, techniques, approaches etc) from which a course developer can select.</p>
        
<h3>The Umbrella Application</h3>
<p>The field guide is accompanied by an <a href="https://eduvation.up.ac.za/apps/blended/">Umbrella Application</a> (App). This app is a self assessment tool that consists of eight different dimensions. Academics can consult the eight dimensions within the app and use this structure  </p>
<ul><li>record existing practices;</li>
<li> self-identify features of their
course within the eight categories;
and </li>
<li> create a record of the current
practices to be used as
benchmarks for future reference</li></ul>
<h3>Anticipated outcome</h3>
        <p>This app is designed to prompt  reflection on a current blended course. After working through the app’s eight dimensions and identifying the types of implementation, a picture of the width and depth of digital adoption, in the form of coloured panels set into the umbrella, will emerge. </p>  
<p>We hope that academics will consider the feedback from the umbrella app, explore the field guide and use the links to a wide range of digital practices to improve their course, where you see fit.</p> 
<p>We assume that some of these ideas will be adopted, appropriated and blended into blended contexts. We also know that other suggestions will be parked or rejected. Blended courses depend the mixture of a range of variables. We intend to provoke critical thought and pragmatic inspiration within those who want to take their hybrid learning approach up a notch</p>

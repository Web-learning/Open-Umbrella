        <h3>Posting and voice</h3>
        <p>
    Students find posting in "public" intimidating. They might be concerned
    about their spelling or grammar. Or be worried about what others might
    think about their intellectual prowess. Or they could not know what to say.
    These are normal reactions. A good habit is to copy and paste your thread
    into a Word document prior to posting your response online. It’s always a
    good idea to re-read your response before you post. In addition:
</p>
<p>
    The content that is posted on this forum should be suitable for
    assessment. <br/>     Make sure your post relates to the topic and the unit.
</p>
<p>
Good posts should have three elements:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>    o What you think;

            </li>
<li>Why you think and what you want to know; and</li>
<li>Whether the assessment is self or peer based.</li>

</ul>

<p>
  · If someone replies to your post with a question, you owe him or her the
    courtesy of a response. <br/>
    · You are also responsible for posting your answers and replies on time.
</p>
<h3>What should I include in my post?
</h3>
<p>
    Posting and responding to topics and each other can be a bit intimidating.
    Here are three steps to follow when you post:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step 1: What do I think? </strong>
</p>
<p>
    You are posting under a particular topic. This is where you write down your
    considered thought in response to that question, statement or response.
    Remember to keep it on topic.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step 2: Why do I think what I think?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You are going to share your own understanding. You might have to examine
    your own experiences, beliefs, or knowledge. Or you might to provide
    references, quotes, and / or links to materials to back up your opinion.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Step 3: What I want to know?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You are going to promote interaction with each other. Ask a question. Write
    down what you want to know. You could direct this question as the lecturer.
    But it could also be directed at classmates.

    <strong>What is expected of people who post?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk18586838">
        · Any discussion board is a shared and public space. When posting on a
        forum, we’d advise you to keep things constructive.
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    · No 'flaming'. Avoid personal attacks, pettiness, and abuse. Respect other
    users, and if you disagree with them, explain why.
</p>
<p>
    · No 'trolling'. Trolls post messages that are deliberately intended to
    provoke an angry or emotional response. Forums are a space to present
    different positions and respond to them. Sometimes these positions and
    responses might be controversial, but the intention behind these posts are
    intended to explore different opinions.
</p>
<p>
· No personal disputes. Forums are not the place to engage in    <em>ad hominum</em> attacks. If matters get personal, sort out the issue
    offline, preferably face to face.
</p>
<p>
    · No sarcasm. Sarcasm is about ten times worse when expressed online.
</p>
<p>
    · Avoid using CAPS LOCK. Use capital letters appropriately in your
    sentences. Typing something in capital letters is considered shouting or
    yelling.
</p>
<p>
    · Let it go. It is not helpful to harp on about the same thing. Neither is
    it valuable to go back to previous arguments. Neither are productive, and
    if you refuse to move on, it’s probable that you will end up going in
    circles.
</p>
<p>
    · Don't post in anger. If someone else's post offends you, it can be very
    easy to post an angry and rude response. Before posting, remember that what
    you are saying will be read and remembered by others. Take a deep breath
    and think before you press the submit button.

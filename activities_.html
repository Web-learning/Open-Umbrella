                <h2>To Begin: Modular Structures</h2>
        <p>A hybrid course is usually divided into multiple units. Each unit contains course materials, learning
activities, assignments, and assessments for that unit. </p>
         <ul>
        <li><a href="activities-modular.html">Modular structures</a>:   A modular architecture offers the course designer with more options. Smaller components of a course allows the off campus student to see how the elements  fit together and offers them a structure for navigating their way around a course.

             </li></ul>
        <h2>To Try: Interaction Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>In class, participation can take many forms. They range from open ended questions intended to focus the whole class’ attention on a big idea, to group projects where teams are led through an investigation that demands complex reasoning or problem solving, to one on one question and answer conversations before and after the lecture.</p>
        <ul>
             <li><a href="activities-participation.html">Participation Rubric</a>: Students should be expected to be involved in their learning, whether face to face (f2f) or online. This participation rubric can help to clarify interaction expectations. 
                </li>
             
             </ul>

        
                <h2>To Consider: Learning Activities that Promote "Participation"</h2>
        <p>Active learning is an accepted method for engaging students in what they are learning. As a  pedagogical strategy, active learning will differ in class (synchronous and f2f) and digital (asynchronous online learning environments) settings. </p>
     <ul><li><a href="activities-muddiest.html">Muddiest Point:</a> This activity asks students to jot down a quick response to the question What was the muddiest point in _______? The purpose is to provide information about what students find most confusing in a unit or topic.</li>
         <li><a href="activities-minute.html">Minute Paper:</a> This writing activity is not an assessment or for recall. It’s for students to “identify the most important point they leaned today” and “what key questions remain unanswered” and then to share their responses.</li>
         <li><a href="activities-think.html">Think-Pair-Share:</a> This short learning activity offers students time and structure for thinking on a given topic, enabling them to formulate individual ideas and share these ideas with a peer.

</li>

</ul>

        <h2>To Do: Using Learning Activities </h2>
         <ul>
             <li><a href="activities-todo.html">Decision Making Checklist</a>: a lecturer will need to consider how learning activities can be structured and arranged within a hybrid course. This checklist offers points for them to consider.

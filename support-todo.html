<h2>To Do - Using UID to design support</h2>
<p>Having read the panel about support strategies, use this checklist of UID principles and suggestions to think about how to consider the support possibilities for those who are enrolled.</p>
<strong>1</strong>.<strong>Equitable use</strong>        
<p>Design of online course materials
considers accessibility for differently
abled students
</p>
<ul class="checked-list">
<li>Statement inviting differently
abled students to meet with the
lecturer published at the start of the
semester
</li><li>Lecture is aware of processes and resources for disability related
accommodation
</li><li>Electronic resources meet
accessibility criteria (http://www.
w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref)
</li><li>Online reading materials are
tested using screen-reading
software such as JAWS (http://www.
freedomscientific.com/jaws-hq.asp)
</li><li>Software that is prescribed
is compatible with assistive
technology</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>2</strong>.<strong>Flexibility in use</strong>
        <p>Design accommodates individual
preferences and abilities; is inclusive</p>
    
        <ul class="checked-list">
<li>Study materials are available
in different formats (e.g. digital
equivalents of hard copy handouts)
</li><li>Resources are designed so they can be reused in a number of settings
(e.g., in class, online, groups)
</li><li>Information is presented using a
variety of media inside and outside
of class (e.g., verbal, text and
images, audio, video, etc.)
</li><li>Lecturer is familiar with the
availability and suitability of
different file formats
</li><li>Lecturer is familiar with process by
which materials can be generated
and easily converted into multiple
formats
</li><li>Lecturer can provide additional
information about file size of the
materials in parenthesis
            </li>
        </ul>
<strong>3</strong>.<strong>Simple and intuitive</strong>        
<p>Design eliminates unnecessary
complexity and considers the
measures to ensure that the interface
remains clear and intuitive</p>
<ul class="checked-list">
        <li>            
Pro-active technology support is
offered
</li><li>Third party ebooks, CDs or webbased
tutorials are checked
for proper navigation and user
feedback;
</li><li>Usability testing across different
devices and among differently abled
students is conducted
</li><li>Lecturer includes mechanisms that
promote peer assistance
</li><li>Lecturer uses “ALT” (alternate text)
tags to offer a textual description to
accompany key diagrams or images
</li>
        </ul>
<strong>4</strong>.<strong>Perceptible information</strong>
   <p>Design considers how students
perceive and comprehend
information that is presented
regardless of ambient conditions</p> 

<ul class="checked-list"><li>Presentations are legible (minimum 20 pt. font, with a high contrast colour scheme)
</li><li>Text and diagrams are sufficiently
far from edges of slide to make
organisation of information clear
through “white” or empty space
</li><li>Background that does not interfere
with diagrams or text
</li><li>Diagrams focus on critical elements,
not excessive in detail,
</li><li>Lecturer employs “excerpt”
diagrams to identify key
components
</li><li>Lecturer takes measures are taken
that address readability (glare,
inadequate lighting, font face etc)
are considered.
        </li>
</ul>
        <strong>5</strong>.
<strong>Tolerance for error</strong>
<p>Design minimises the adverse
consequences of accidental or
unintended actions</p>
<ul class="checked-list"><li>
    If student work is uploaded in
error, then the lecturer offers the
opportunity (within a reasonable
time period) to rectify a mistake
</li><li>If forms are used, then form
validation is used to check that key
fields are completed
</li><li>Lecturer allows for ample time for
submission of online work in case of
system malfunction
</li><li>“Buffers” are built into the
schedule to address unexpected
contingencies
</li><li>Checklists, graphic organisers
and mind maps are included as
mechanisms to reduce cognitive
load</li>    
        </ul>
        <strong>6</strong>.
<strong>Low physical effort</strong>
  <p>Design is used to minimises fatigue
and allow for maximum attention to
learning
</p>
<ul class="checked-list">
    <li>
        The amount of clicking, scrolling, or
hunting for information (maximum
of three clicks) is reduced
</li><li>Students are encouraged to work in pairs if the work requires students
to physically exert themselves
</li><li>When library services are included,
a range of mechanisms that allow
students to access from on and off
campus locations thereby reducing
the need for travel are introduced
</li><li>Assignments minimise nonessential
tasks (e.g., learning
irrelevant software just to access
information)
      </li>
     </ul>
<strong>7</strong>.<strong>Size and space for
approach and use</strong>
        <p>Design considers reach, manipulation
and use, regardless of body size,
            posture or mobility</p>
<ul class="checked-list"><li>High contrast large print signage is
used for wayfinding
</li><li>Emergency instructions are clear
and visible
</li><li>Means of access to resources
(computers, printed materials and
electronic) are considered
</li><li>If transportation is necessary,
then accessible transportation is
        available</li></ul>

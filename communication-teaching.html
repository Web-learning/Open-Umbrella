        <h2>To Consider - Presence </h2>
        <h3>Teaching Presence</h3>
        <p>In a face to face course, even in a big class, you’ve created a perception of care through the combination of personal attention and academic interest. The psychological distance between the lecturer and student depends on the immediate verbal and non-verbal behaviour in the communication exchange.  In mediated communication, it can be difficult to “read” the social and emotional connections between communicating parties. </p><p>A meaningful teacher presence can be developed that allows for inter and intra-personal communication and the development of a sense of care. This care can be engendered both on screens and in seats, whether seated behind a row of desks, or around a table in an out of a classroom setting or in an online forum. Yet it is necessary to purposefully create an inviting out-of-classroom environment.  In mediated communications, there is a tendency to develop more extreme perceptions than in face to face situations since the range of non-verbal cues has been reduced. </p>

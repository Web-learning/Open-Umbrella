<h3>Introduction</h3>        
		<p class="drop-cap">You suddenly realise that the normal pattern of lectures and tutorials can be replicated online. This is possible. But we think that you could do better than simply looking for online equivalents to deliver content. </p>
		
		<p>Helping students to understand the 
differences is a vital and important
part of preparing a student for working online in their. There’s not necessarily a neat fit between student’s expectations and
actual university realities.</p>
			
	<p>	We think that online's NEW flexibility is wonderful, but concomitantly creates logistical challenges to students as they juggle their routines with an array of approaches that differ between different classes.</p>
		<blockquote>I am concerned with my students
cannot find their way around
administrative systems and academic
procedures. I know about the many
logistical challenges associated with staying on track and have seen how
some lack experience within
our internal systems. Some students bewilderment affects their learning journey.</blockquote>
<h3>Keeping organized</h3>
		<p>Things change for both students and academics when they go online. It's helpful to think about some of the mundane academic details that need to be tracked. </p>

		<ul><li><strong>The place</strong>:What lecture, room, lab, etc or live-stream, lecture capture or website will the students be "ingabiting".</li>
			<li><strong>The pace</strong>:Is the learning event scheduled at a specific time or can you watch it anytime? Are there changes in assignments due dates</li>
			<li><strong>The mode</strong>:What are the in-person and remote parts of the class?</li>

		</ul>
		
<h3>Schedules</h3>
		<p>Setting a schedule offers a structure. A simple daily or weekly calendarallows a student to organize their time. </p>

			<article><h2>Digital learning is different</h2> 
					<p>Digital learning is different in at least
three ways – pace, place and mode:
<ul><li><strong>Pace:</strong> Hybrid learning provides
the opportunity for students to
extend their learning beyond
classroom interactions. Students
may now do online preparative
work before class; or those who
struggle to keep up during a class
may review online videos, narrated
PowerPoints or class notes after
class at their own pace when they
have time.</li>
	<li><strong>Place:</strong> Students have greater
freedom to learn within different
environments (college or
university, home, library, public
transport while commuting, or
abroad when travelling) as long
as they have a digital device and
access to the internet.
</li>
	<li><strong>Mode:</strong> Students can be taught
with a greater variety of media or
tools and these can be structured
in a way that is engaging and
participative. This approach means
that learning can become more
student centred.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Students do not necessariliy know what is
required from them. Expecting them all to step up and manage their admin responsibilities from off campus is difficult. Many security and privacy mechanisms introduce new hurdles.   </p>

                <h2>To Begin: Course Home Page </h2>
     <ul><li>The <a href="administration-home.html">launching point</a> of a course is the homepage. It is intended to introduce a course, describe its purpose and significance. This is where the mindset of the lecturer, their philosophy of teaching and learning, as well as their attitude towards students becomes established. </li>
         <li><a href="administration-visual.html">Visual Syllabus:</a> </li>
         <li><a href="administration-template.html">Syllabus Template:</a> </li>

         
        </ul>
        <h2>To Consider:Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
        <ul><li> A course outline (or syllabus) is a useful way to pre-empt common problems that might occur during a course.  But a syllabus is often glossed over by inexperienced students because it overwhelming and seems meaningless. FAQ allows students to jump to immediate questions and answers. </li></ul>
        
    <h2>To Try:Times and Schedules</h2>
        <ul><li>One of the more complex challenges in a further education setting is managing the many
competing and shifting priorities. A “<a href="administration-schedule.html">course schedule</a>” is a staple element of
any course. </li></ul>

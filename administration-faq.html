      <h2>To Consider - Syllabus</h2>
      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions </h3>
      <p>The course outline (or syllabus) is where learning outcomes, content
        and assessments are laid out. This document can also be used
        pro-actively. To anticipate questions or pre-empt problems that
        frequently crop up among students. <strong>Syllabus bloat</strong>” is
        a result of putting
        too much information into a course
        upfront.</p>
      <p>Common questions and standard
        answers could be a nifty way to guide students to the intended
        information as quick as possible.
        This kind of information is usually known as
        a FAQ (frequently asked questions). You might want to call it the “Help
        Desk” or
        “Tips and Tricks”. </p>
      <p>A good FAQ should
        allow students to go to the immediate
        question (thus saving time) and receive
        a consistent answer. FAQ needs to guide and inform the student
        information needs. Here are five tips to creating an
        effective FAQ:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find current problems that students are facing and re-frame these
          questions as your headings.</li>
        <li>Ensure that questions have a specific focus (write in second person,
          not third or first).</li>
        <li> Make the tone engaging, but don’t sound like a salesperson.</li>
        <li>Arrange alphabetically and be consistent with your style (format,
          highlighting, bullets) so they are easily scanned.</li>
        <li>Segment the FAQ by audience or type of question.</li>
      </ul>

                <h2>To Do: Techno teacher checklist </h2>
<p>Having read the panel about teaching and learning strategies that are enabled with technology, you might want to think about your current use of technology. Use the following checklist to identify your current use of digital to support your teaching or students learning. And then think about how you might exploit the attributes of technology to achieve enriched teaching experiences or perhaps create better learning experiences that are not possible through the use of face to face teaching or technology alone. </p>
   <ul class="checked-list">
       <li>I use digital technologies to prepare for teaching
       </li><li>I use digital technologies to enhance live teaching / learning interactions e.g. via classroom technologies such as clickers
       </li><li>I use digital technologies to support synchronous learning interactions e.g. via videoconferencing technologies to offer a webinar
       </li><li>I use digital technologies to support asynchronous learning interactions e.g. via the discussion forums for a group work task
       </li><li>I use digital technologies to monitor progress and identify students who require assistance e.g. via course stats to monitor completion
       </li><li>I use digital technologies to deliver pre-packaged modules that are course pre-requisites e.g. via the LMS to teach statistics
       </li><li>I use digital technologies to develop and make available digital resources to support learning e.g. podcasts, screencasts, online presentations, video, open educational resources, reusable learning objects
       </li><li>I design online learning activities using a wide range of LMS or third-party tools
       </li><li>I provide opportunities for students to use tools so that students can find, choose and evaluate online resources relevant to their learning e.g. searching for open educational resources, data sets, online journal articles and e-books, academic blogs and websites
       </li><li>I design activities that encourage studentsâ€™ participation in digital collaborations e.g. via apps that support social networking environments or social referencing
       </li><li>I provide multiple opportunities for students to develop their digital capabilities and learning skills e.g. online information literacy, online communication skills, note-taking and curation, digital reflection
       </li><li>I provide multiple opportunities for students to use academic, professional and commercial technologies as relevant to their subject of study e.g. CAD for engineers, data analysis for computer scientists
       </li><li>I encourage and support activities that promote teaching and / or support learning effectively in digital settings
       </li>

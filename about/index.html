          <h2>What does Weblearning offer</h2>
          <p class="drop-cap">Weblearning helps communities and practitioners
            within the educational, developmental and training sectors to
            understand and respond to the challenges of using the web for
            teaching and learning. Instead of focussing on the traditional
            organisational needs (advertising, communication, administration),
            Weblearning attempts to understand what their online users want and
            need and act accordingly. </p>

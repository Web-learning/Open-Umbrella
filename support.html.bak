<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p class="drop-cap">We know that technology does not
have all the answers. We are working
together on establishing a set of norms
where receiving support is welcome
and ongoing. We think that technology
offers the means toproactively consider
the needs of all students and offer
necessary support to accomplish
academic goals.</p>
<blockquote>We have noted that students are not
equally prepared for tertiary studies.
We recognise the diversity of student
experiences within our classes and
accept the argument that “access
without support is not opportunity ”.</blockquote>				
			<p>We celebrate the considered
use, adoption and application of
technologies by lecturers in their curriculum. </p><p> We’re not advocating for
the use of “nannyware” or labelling
(and thereby demotivating students).
We are asking how can an institution
set up systems to monitor risk, deploy
nudges or offer differentiated support
and then make it possible for lecturers
and students to work in conjunction
with systems to address vexing support
challenges</p>
				
				<p>
If we want to promote inclusive student
support to off campus students, then
we need to go beyond making sure
that students have access to the online
components of a hybrid class. We need
to enquire how data, information and
machine learning might be leveraged
to offer sustained advice and support.</p>
<p>
If this data is used ethically and with
consent, then this information can
pro-actively contribute towards the
intellectual, social and emotional
support services that is available to
students on and off campus. And
ensure that an appropriate and ongoing
set of academic and non academic
support services are
available to all.</p>
				
<p>We support 
critical questions, we welcome those who trouble technology narratives and avoid easy answers. We have seen the many
unintended consequences that result
from a “one size fits all” approach to
				teaching.</p>

			<article><h4>Beyond access</h4>
<p>We can be slow to appreciate the
differences between the virtual
student experience and on campus
life. To recognise how our academic
and non academic support strategies
favour face to face encounters. </p>
<ul><li><strong>On
campus students</strong> can enter a learning
environment immediately after passing
through the security gate. They access
the help desk during office hours,
they visit the drop-in centre in person
(instead of online) and sign up for a
workshop on the notice board located
	outside the seminar room.</li>
	<li><strong>
Off campus students</strong> are expected
to remember multiple passwords,
change proxy settings or install a VPN,
request specific permissions from
administrators of IT services. When they
are out of sight, they are often out of
mind. They have to work far harder to
scale the high virtual campus walls to
		locate support.</li>

<p>Let's offer connections
and create a sense of belonging in a
class, no matter where students are located.
Within a hybrid course it is possible to
hear (anonymous) student feedback,
identify problems earlier, and offer
remediation. We need to find ways to
use technologies to break down the
one size fits all approach to education
that engenders a sense of isolation or
marginalisation.</p>

                <h2>To Begin: Getting Technical  </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="support-minimum.html">Minimum levels</a>: Technologies have always promised quicker routes to access education. Navigating these roads,
for some, is easy. The pathways are familiar and well worn. For others, the technology is daunting and
students feel inadequate for the journey. Still for others, technology is the only viable trail available.</li>
            <li><a href="support-byod.html">BYOD (Bring Your Own Devices)</a>: Widespread ownership of mobile devices among students means that many students will use them to connect, read, access and locate more data and information, complete tasks and support other personal learning needs. Their own (or perhaps shared) devices are a central pivot around which they organize their lives.</li>
                        <li><a href="support-started.html">Getting started on the LMS:</a> 
To access the LMS you will need to
be registered as a student and know
your student number (preferably memorised). The look around for "Student Orientation" courses. You will find information about password, help desk, basic settings etc that will help you get started.   
            </li>

            </ul>
<h2>To try: Technical instructions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="support-technical.html">Technical Guidelines</a> can just be a list of minimum specifications. But they can also be practical and require a student to apply themselves to following a set of instructions. This is a useful skill to practice, especially at the beginning of a course. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>To Consider: Digital Nudges</h2>
        <ul><li><a href="support-data.html">Data informed advice and Support</a>: Giving students access to information about their own engagement and performance is a useful way to “nudge” them to increase their time on task. Digital nudges are not instructions. They are
subtle reminders to help students who might be at risk.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>To Do: Support Checklist</h2>
        <ul><li><a href="support-todo.html">Support Checklist:</a> All students should be able to rely on support being available to accomplish their academic goals. By using
Universal Instructional Design (UID)
principles to anticipate and plan for the
diverse needs of students, inclusive access that addresses accessibility challenges and contributes towards a sense of belonging is created.

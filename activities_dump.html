<p>Learning activities: The &ldquo;passive&rdquo; student</p>
<p>"Is it down-loadable?"</p>
<p>Voice 1: I bring years of experience to my subject. I can tell students about what they need to know, why this is important and the context wherein that knowledge is needed. The prescribed textbook is very comprehensive. My notes reduce this density, my slides are concise and focus on the application of this information, especially for exams. When I ask if there are any questions, they keep quiet. I think it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m explaining things well. </p>
<p>Voice 2 I have high expectations about participation. My students are more than spectators. Listening to me and taking notes is only a minimum expectation. I&rsquo;m looking for new opportunities for students to respond to each other and then with me. I set &ldquo;doing&rdquo; tasks that make participation possible, even in a big class. You don&rsquo;t actually learn until you engage. </p>
<p>Voice 3 My online students are reserved and despite my attempts to involve them, I generally find that levels of participation are low. This means that it is difficult to determine whether they have understood what has been taught online. </p>
<p>Scenario - an active classroom</p>
<p>You walk into a room and see students huddled together in small groups discussing. The lecturer stops them after about a minute, call randomly on several individuals for responses and gets more responses from volunteers, and then proceeds with your lecture. The whole process takes less than three minutes, during which most or all of the students are awake and actively engaged with the course material. </p>
<p>You speak to the instructional designer and logs you into an online learning environment where students and academics are using technologies in a manner that allows them to respond to each other, make different judgment calls, admit to not knowing or offering assistance to others. The format seems quite different from what you have experienced in class.</p>
<p>Learning activities that requires student participation or interactions with the learning process, as opposed to passively taking in information, leads to better performance. Whether it be discussions, problem solving, exploring new concepts. 45 minute lectures, whether in front of a class, or recorded and posted to YouTube, does not necessariliy help cognitive process and lead to internalisation. </p>
<p>Active learning, either in the form of in-class interactions or online activities or tasks, are useful to activate students&rsquo; prior knowledge, motivate them to take action and help bridge ideas from familiar concrete contexts to an abstract concept.</p>
<p>When differnt apps or tools are combined with learning activities, then these tool offer new levers to enable an activity centered classroom.</p>
<p>Online Learning Activities </p>
<p>If you are experienced with active learning, then you might "wing it" in front of a class in a lecture hall. But the mechanics for fostering interaction and dialogue between online students needs to be considered and prepared ahead of time. Spontaneous learning activities should be </p>
<ul>
<li>Fit for purpose: the activity that has been selected matches the learning outcomes while also being cogniscent of the technical challenges a user might face.</li>
<li>Visually appealing : the images that are used with the learning activity are clear and engaging. They prompt participation and communicate the need for engagement with others</li>
<li>Clearly communicated prior to the activity: a clear and concise sequence of steps or directions are written up to introduce the learning activity to participants. The instructions also include steps that offer support to common issues and anticipates some of the potential roadblocks that might affect the user</li>
</ul>
<p>From student passivity to student activity</p>
<p>Students and academics become comfortable with predictable teaching methodologies. Watching, listening and taking notes is the standard pattern for learning. There is however, no single "most effective" way of learning. Active learning happens when you pose a problem, when students are requested to address a current issue, set them a challenge; divide them into small groups, give them some time to do it; stop them, and then expect them to share their responses.</p>
<p>Student reactions to this methodological changes will not necessarily be positive . Honey and Mumford&rsquo;s learning types model describes different four students preferences. The framework can be used to explain different student&rsquo;s responses to new alternate teaching methodologies (such as active learning).</p>
<p>Activists respond most positively to learning situations offering challenge, to, new experiences and problems in their learning.</p>
<p>Reflectors respond most positively to structured learning activities where they are provided with time to observe, reflect and think, and allowed to work in a detailed manner.</p>
<p>Theorists respond well to logical, rational structure and clear aims, where they are given time for methodical exploration and opportunities to question and stretch their intellect.</p>
<p>Pragmatists respond most positively to practically based, immediately relevant learning activities, which allow scope for practice and using theory.</p>
<p> The standard lecture pattern (watching, listening, taking notes) allows an academic to explain, clarify, model, demonstrate their expertise. We are not suggesting that this pattern be abandoned. But a lecturer can also include learning activities that, even in a few minutes, allows them to practice and receive feedback on. </p>

<p> Student-Initiated Contact with Other Students</p>
<ul>
<li>Students have no or limited opportunities to ÔÅ± engage in regular effective contact with other students (e.g., limited to a single Q&amp;A discussion forum only).</li>
<li>Regular effective contact among students is designed and facilitated to build a sense of community among students.</li>

<p>To begin: Structuring a unit or module </p>
<p>A hybrid course is usually divided up into multiple units. Each unit contains course materials, learning activities, assignments, and assessments for that unit. A modular structure offers the course designer and students advantages. Riggs &amp; Linder (2016) see the following advantages in such an arrangement of smaller parts. It</p>
<ul>
<li>paces the learning experience to prioritize information and activities and to help prevent students from feeling overwhelmed;</li>
<li>allows students to monitor progress regularly;</li>
<li>discourages procrastination by providing regular milestones and deliverables;</li>
<li>visually provides a high-level overview of the course topics, which can increase understanding of how course topics relate to one another</li>
<li>provides space to scaffold active learning experiences and to provide sufficient opportunity for guidance and feedback on reflection activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>These units, modules or parts are necessary not because students have short attention spans or are unmotivated, but because the absence of a physical and face-to-face social architecture necessitates an alternative virtual architecture. </p>
<p>Structure of a unit </p>
<p>This e-activities checklist by Gilly Salmon offers ten tips for structuring a unit or module </p>
<ol>
<li>Number: Within a sequence of in class and online activities, a student needs to know where it fits within the overall course</li>
<li>Heading: A catchy, attention grabbing title. </li>
<li>Period: The total amount of time required to complete the activity</li>
<li>Outcomes: A clear statement of what students will get out of the learning activity.</li>
<li>Task Summary: Introduction about &ldquo;what you&rsquo;re going to do&rdquo;</li>
<li>Spark: A trigger, whether it be a little video, example, case study or picture, but keep it short. </li>
<li>Details: More explicit instructions for the students with links to further resources if necessary </li>
<li>Call to action: Expected tools to use for student&rsquo;s work and their response to another student&rsquo;s work with links to further resources if necessary</li>
<li>Feedback: Anticipated feedback, perhaps a summary, perhaps a weave that pulls together all the various contributions.</li>
<li>Next steps: A link to the next activity </li>
</ol>
<p>Adapted from G Salmon </p>
<p>Communicating the details clearly</p>
<p>Take a look at a learning activity. Use the five headings to consider whether it is structured in a manner that clearly communicates all the details necessary to comprehend and complete the activity or task.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Does the introduction draw the student in by relating to the students&rsquo; interests, putting the students into a scenario, describing a problem, or by asking a compelling question?</li>
<li>Does the introduction build upon prior knowledge and introduce or foreshadow future work?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Task or activity</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Is it very clear to the student what they will have accomplished after completing the task?</li>
<li>Is the task that has been set do-able and engaging?</li>
<li>Does the task encourage higher order thinking?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Process</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Is every step in the process section clearly stated so that the students will understand what they are to do?</li>
<li>Are checks for understanding built into the process?</li>
<li>Are the activities within the process clearly related and are they designed to take students further up in their thinking?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Relevance, quality and quantity of the resources</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Are the resources of instructional value to the students?</li>
<li>Do the resources hyperlink to the correct Web sites?</li>
<li>Is the layout and design appropriate for the students?</li>
<li>Are there appropriate, thematic graphic elements throughout the activity that help students understand the concepts and relationships presented?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Clarity of assessment criteria</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the assessment rubric clearly communicate to the students what is going to be assessed?</li>
<li>Does it provide a list of criteria for appropriate levels of performance?</li>
<li>Does the rubric match the learning outcomes?</li>
<li>Does the conclusion summarize what the students have accomplished and learned?</li>
</ul>
<p>To consider: Five learning activities to promote &ldquo;participation &rdquo; </p>
<p>Learning activity*</p>
<p>Active learning is an accepted method for engaging students in what they are learning. As a pedagogical strategy, active learning will differ in class (synchronous and face-to-face) and digital (asynchronous online learning environments) settings.</p>

<p>To try: Foreground the importance of participation </p>
<p>Students should be expected to be activity involved in their learning, whether face-to-face or online. </p>
<p>In class, participation can take many forms. They range from open ended questions intended to focus the whole class&rsquo; attention on a big idea, to group projects where teams are led through an investigation that demands complex reasoning or problem solving, to one on one question and answers conversations before and after the lecture.</p>
<p>The same kind of face to face participation will not be replicated in the online portion of a hybrid course (and rightly so). When encouraging active learning and interaction online, it is probably necessary to clarify what constitutes as participation. </p>
<p>Is one to one messages participation? Or is substantiative dialogue that builds upon posts and responses? The expectations around interaction should be stated up front.</p>
<p>The types of participation can be defined in a rubric. Below is a sample syllabus communication and engagement policy for a hybrid course, which communicates an expectation for participation upfront.</p>
<p>Peer participation</p>
<p>This is a hybrid course and the class is arranged into weekly units. We meet face to face in class every alternate week and the other portion of the class takes place online (the dates during which we meet face to face are clearly indicated in bold font on the syllabus schedule). Attendance at the face-to-face classes and regular participation (whether in class or online activities) is required. </p>
<p>Whether we are meeting face to face or working online, you will be expected to go online to continue discussion or complete other activities. Your participation is measured by how much you engage with peers and the lecturer in synchronous and asynchronous discussions.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>        
		<p class="drop-cap">
			<h3>Modular Structures</h3>
        <p>
 A hybrid course is usually divided into multiple units. Each unit contains course materials, learning
activities, assignments, and assessments for that unit. A modular architecture offers the course
designer with more options. Smaller components of a course allows the off campus student to see
how the elements fit together and offers them a structure for navigating their way around a course </p>
        <table><th></th><tr><td>My course is loosely structured and students are directed to the topic when necessary.</td><td>My course is divided into modules and units. Students work steadily through this structure.</td><td>My course is modular and students are active doing tasks as they work through different topics.</td></tr></table>

            A modular structure offers the course designer and students
    advantages. Riggs &amp; Linder(2016) see the following advantages in such
    an arrangement of smaller parts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Visually providing <strong>a high-level overview</strong> of the course topics, which can increase understanding of how course topics relate to one another; and</li>
<li>Providing space to <strong>scaffold active learning experiences</strong> and to provide sufficient opportunity for guidance and feedback on reflection activities.</li>
<li><strong>Pacing</strong> the learning experience to prioritise information and activities and to help prevent students from feeling overwhelmed</li>
<li>Allowing students to <strong>monitor</strong> progress regularly;</li>
<li>Discouraging <strong>procrastination</strong> by providing regular milestones and deliverables;</li>
</ul>
<p>
    These units, modules or parts are necessary not because students have short
    attention spans or are unmotivated, but because the absence of a physical
    and face to face social architecture necessitates an alternative virtual
    architecture.

<h4>Creating a structure  </h4>

<p>
    This checklist offers ten tips for structuring a unit or module.
</p>
		
		<ul>
<li><strong>Number</strong>: Within a sequence of in-class and online activities, a student needs to know where it fits within the overall course</li>
<li><strong>Heading</strong>: A catchy, attention grabbing title</li>
<li><strong>Period</strong>: The total amount of time required to complete the activity</li>
<li><strong>Outcomes</strong>: A clear statement of what students will get out of the learning activity</li>
<li><strong>Task Summary</strong>: Introduction about &ldquo;what you&rsquo;re going to do&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Spark:</strong> A trigger, whether it be a little video, example, case study or picture, but keep it short.</li>
<li><strong>Details</strong>: More explicit instructions for the students with links to further resources if necessary</li>
<li><strong>Call to action</strong>: Expected tools to use for students&rsquo; work and their response to another student&rsquo;s work with links to further resources if necessary</li>
<li><strong>Feedback</strong>: Anticipated feedback, perhaps a summary, perhaps a weave that pulls together all the various contributions</li>
<li><strong>Next steps</strong>: A link to the next activity</li>
</ul>

    <strong>Modular tips and prompts</strong>
</p>
		<p>Take a look at any  learning activity. Whether it be used in class or online. Use
the five headings to consider whether
it is structured in a manner that clearly
communicates all the details necessary
to comprehend and complete the
activity or task.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>
   Does the introduction draw the student in by relating to the student’s
    interests, putting the students inside a scenario, describing a problem, or
    by asking a compelling question?
</li>
<li>
    Does the introduction build upon prior knowledge and introduce or
    foreshadow future work?</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Task or activity</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>    Is it very clear to the student what they will have accomplished after
    completing the task?
</li>
<li>
    Is the task that has been set do-able and engaging? Does it require the
    activation of the six behaviours?
</li>
<li>
    Does the task encourage higher order thinking?
	</li>
		</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Process</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>
    Is every step in the process section clearly stated so that students will
    understand what they are to do?
</li>
<li>
    Are checks for understanding built into the process?
</li>
<li>
    Are the activities within the process clearly related and are they
    designed to evolve students’ thinking?
	</li>
		</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Relevance, quality and quantity of the resources</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>
    Are the resources of instructional value to the students?
</li>
<li>
    Do the resources hyperlink to the correct websites?
</li>
<li>
    Is the layout and design appropriate for the students?
</li>
<li>
    Are there appropriate, thematic graphic elements throughout the activity
    that help students understand the concepts and relationships presented?
	</li>
		</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Clarity of assessment criteria</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>
    Does the assessment rubric clearly communicate to the students what is
    going to be assessed?
</li>
<li>
    Does it provide a list of criteria for appropriate levels of performance?
</li>
<li>
    Does the rubric match the learning outcomes?
</li>
<li>
    Does the conclusion summarise what the students have accomplished and
    learned?
</li>
</ul>

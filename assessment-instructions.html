      <span>E-assessments have two main elements. The </span>
      <span class="c27">instrument</span>
      <span> (where the evidence of understanding is collected) and the </span>
      <span class="c27">instructions</span>
      <span class="c0"> (the steps to follow when using the instrument). It’s very easy to neglect the latter. In order for the student to understand the intended use of the instrument, these points should be addressed</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c11 c19">
      <span class="c27">Case studies</span>
      <span class="c0">: You will be discussing, analysing and writing cases studies during course (F2F and online). Case studies make what we are learning about more apparent and they offer a realistic (and complex) view of a particular situation.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c11 c19">
      <span class="c27 c68">Case Discussion</span>
      <span class="c0">: Every week, I will post a video case study to the discussion board. Before the contact session, I expect you to watch it, prepare your response and contribute towards the discussion of a solution on the appropriate topic. In class, there will be a short low stakes quiz, where you will articulate your own response to this case. The quiz is designed for you and is intended to check for comprehension and prompt recall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c11 c19">
      <span class="c68 c27">Case Analysis</span>
      <span class="c0">: During the semester, I will expect you to choose a minimum of 5 cases to analyse. Submitted analyses will be marked according to the rubric posted alongside each case. In class, you will be called upon to make connections between content being taught and your own analysis of a case. Excellent contributions will be rewarded. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c11 c19">
      <span class="c68 c27">Case Scenario</span>
      <span class="c0">: In the final week of the course, I expect you to produce your own case scenario. This work will be based on your case analysis and case discussions. It will consist of a real-world problem, the dilemma to be resolved and the steps taken to address the issue. Detailed instructions, marking criteria and due dates for this assignment are available in the course schedule. Your own case scenario is the major assessment component of the course. It should be built upon the case discussion and analysis work that you have done thus far.</span>

      <span class="c0">Students’ contributions towards case discussions on the discussion board will noted prior to class. Quality posts will be responded to in class and a brief summary (which will be helpful for your case analysis and case scenario) will be posted at the end of the week. Please make sure you post on the correct topic. The rubric format offers inline feedback for your case analysis. Additional comments can be found in the comments section below the rubric. Because the case scenario is for your final class mark, no feedback will be returned to students.</span>

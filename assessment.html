      <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <article>
          <p class="drop-cap">For many, the word “assessment” conjures up a
            stressful reaction, memories of long hours studying, or getting a
            final good or bad result in an exam. These familiar notions of
            assessment do not capture the wide range of possibilities associated
            with e-assessment and how it could improve understanding and agency
            among students. A blended course designer can re-frame the ways
            assessment is seen and appreciated by students. </p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p><strong>Goals for e-assessment</strong>: To create opportunities
              for students to distill what they know, what they don’t know and
              what they don’t know they don’t know. To foster an approach to
              assessment among students that completes the loop. Assessments
              that are not only about an event, but a process that allows them
              to monitor their own progress.</p>

            <blockquote> An online quiz about a reading can assist a lecturer or
              facilitator to see if the text has been read beforehand and allow
              for personalised feedback. An interactive problem completed
              remotely could determine whether a concept has been understood and
              then link the student back to targeted support. A set of
              self-reflective journal entries that attest to current-level
              skills can show progress over time. Interactive group assignments
              that require collaboration offers induction possibilities, while
              structured peer feedback offers insights that are specific and
              timely. These are the types of assessments that allow for feedback
              and contribute towards the development of learning. </blockquote>

            <h4> Assessment for learning</h4>
            <p class="card">A formative or developmental approach about topic(s)
              to which the student can relate and use to direct future learning.
              This kind of e-assessment takes place during the learning
              programme, rather than at the end (summative), or beginning
              (diagnostic), and can be used repeatedly.</p>

            <h4>Assessment of learning</h4>
            <p class="card">A final assessment of a student’s achievement,
              ultimately leading to a formal qualification or certification of a
              skill. This kind of e-assessment is generally undertaken at the
              end of a course or programme. It is used to make a judgment about
              the candidate’s overall achievement of learning outcomes. </p>

        <h2>To Begin: E-assessment Basics</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="assessment-instructions.html">Instructions</a>: Any
            e-assessment has two main elements, an instrument (where evidence of
            understanding is collected) and a set of instructions (where an
            explanation about the instrument) are given. It is easy to neglect
            the latter and assume that the student understands the intended use
            of the instrument.<br>
            <em>Below are some points to consider when communicating
              e-assessment instructions.</em> </li>
          <li><a href="assessment-dummy.html">Dummy Run</a>: To avoid the
            inevitable technical problems, students should practice with
            e-assessment technology and address common technical hitches and
            glitches early on in the semester. <br>
            <em>Here are recommendations for running a dummy run.</em></li>
          <li><a href="assessment-peer.html">Peer Assessment</a>: Students learn
            when they can explain their ideas to other students and then provide
            feedback to each other. We call this peer learning. Many times,
            these interactions occur outside the classroom. But when these
            student-to-student interactions are structured into class or online
            activities, peer learning becomes peer assessment.
            Comprehension&nbsp; is improved when student are involve in marking
            each others work. As they exercise their judgement, they need to
            understand the purposes of an assessment is and what constitutes
            acceptable evidence of accomplishment. <br>
            <em>Here is a comparison between peer and other assessment.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>To Consider: Auto Marking E-assessment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="assessment-automation.html">Computer assisted assessment</a>:
            Question types such as multiple choice, true or false, matching
            responses and so forth, can be used with a bank of questions to test
            a large class easily and release marks automatically. For lecturers,
            especially those with high enrollment numbers, a reduced marking
            load is welcome. We’ve already mentioned the need for a dummy run to
            address technical issues. But auto marking and the questions that
            are marked need to be thought through quite carefully. <br>
            <em>There are both opportunities and challenges associated with auto
              marking e-assessments </em> </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>To Try:Constructing a Rubrics </h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="assessment-rubrics.html">Sign-post or guides</a>: Rubrics
            allow students to develop their own evaluative judgments. The
            criteria stated in a rubric can act as a sign-post or a guide for
            students. When rubrics are associated with an essay, a presentation,
            lab work, forum contributions etc, they allow students to unpack the
            different dimensions and guide their evaluative judgments with
            benchmarks.<br>
            <em>Three steps to create a rubrics </em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>To Do: E-Assessment Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="assessment-todo.html">Choose how you will use
              e-assessment</a>: Assessment need not only be about high stakes
            tests. Having completed the panel about assessment, you might want
            to include a few new e-assessment practices. <br>
            <em>Use the checklist to guide your future e-assessment practice.</em></li>

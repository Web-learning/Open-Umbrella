        <h2>To Try: Text Alternatives </h2>
<p>Images, audio and video enriches the delivery of course materials by engaging the theatre of the
mind. But video without the audio track, a guest lecture given by an international expert with an
unfamiliar accent, or a pixelated image with insufficient detail are examples of how rich media can
also act as a hindrance.
        </p><p>
Think about what a students would get out of your multimedia resource if they were not able to hear the audio portion, or if they had difficulty understanding your spoken word. A text transcript provides students with equivalent information to the audio content in a multimedia resource. Providing content that is accessible is critical to keeping students with data expenses still connected.</p>
<h3>Audio</h3>   
<p>While audio is a rich medium that
brings many advantages to the
classroom, audio based resources
pose particular challenges for those
with a hearing disability. It is therefore
important to include a text transcript
to provide students with equivalent
information to the audio content. If
you use video with an audio track, it is
advisable to add captions to the video
to offer a visual alternative.</p>        
<h3>Images</h3>
<p> If images are used, ALT (alternative)
text or descriptive text needs to be
provided. If images are used, ALT
(alternative) text or descriptive text
needs to be provided. Alt text is not
immediately visible as it is written
within the HTML code.
<p>Alt text is designed to provide text
explanations of images for students
who are unable to see them:</p>
<ol><li>
    
    Visually impaired students using
screen readers will be able to
read an Alt attribute to better
understand an on-page image.
    </li><li> If an image cannot load, the Alt text
will be displayed in place of the
image.
    
    </li></ol>
<p>To provide good Alt tags, remember
to describe the image as specifically as
possible. Keep to the following rules:</p>        <ol><li>Keep it (relatively) short, within
125 characters so that the screen
readers do not cut off some of the
Alt text.
</li><li>Don’t include “image of,” “picture
of,” etc. in your Alt text.
</li><li>Do not provide a description to
an image used for decorative
purposes.
</li></ol>
<p>Sometimes, alternative text is enough.
If a complex photograph, chart, or
diagram is displayed, it might be
necessary to include more descriptive
text. This can be done in the text
surrounding the image, or in the long
description (longdesc) HTML attribute.</p>
        
<h3>Video.</h3> <p>
It is more time consuming to provide text alternatives to video. But not all of the speech content should be included in the transcript. Here are some exceptions:</p>
<ul><li>
If there is speech that is not relevant, it is usually best to indicate that it has been excluded from the transcript. For example: “[A & B chatted while slides were loading].”
</li><li>
        Don’t be a slave to the video and include headings and sub-headings, especially when the transcript is long. When including these, put them in brackets to show that they were not part of the original audio. For example: [Introduction]; [Group Discussion]; [Case Study].
</li><li>
Descriptions that convey emotions, mood, etc. are usually provided in brackets. For example: “Don’t touch that! [shouted].”
</li><li>
Descriptions of relevant non-speech audio: These are usually provided in brackets. For example: “[metal pipes crashing to concrete floor].” Background noise that isn’t relevant can be left out.</li>
</ul>
<p>The work you put into creating a text transcript for a video resource can be repurposed to provide the captions.</p>

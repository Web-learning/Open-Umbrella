          <p class="drop-cap">Recognise the student whose focus is elsewhere?
            Other interests hold their attention, rather than what is said in
            the immediate lecture or lesson? Digital technologies are often seen
            as a mechanism for content delivery. We assume students are
            receptive vessels They can be much more. You can link what you are
            teaching about to your students immediate circumstances. You can
            create connections beyond your classroom walls. Teachers can use
            technology to listen and involve their students in a learning
            experiences that extends beyond the confines of the pages in a
            textbook. </p>
          <p><strong>Do you see digital as a delivery mechanism. Or as a trigger
              or a lever that can prompt and support meaningful conversations
              and purposeful interactions?&nbsp; </strong></p>
          <p>Teaching approaches such as inquiry-based learning (IBL), mastery
            learning or authentic learning can be enabled with technology. This
            can be much more than an information dump.&nbsp; </p>
          <h4>“Content tyranny”</h4>
          <p>When the need to complete the curriculum receives the higher
            priority than dialogue, care or shared meaning making, then its
            easier to value tools, apps and devices above students well being.
            We forget the underlying values of the subject and the tools become
            the hidden curriculum.&nbsp; </p>

      <h2>To Begin: Engagement and Cognition </h2>
      <p>The use of technology in the class is encouraged. But how exactly, is
        technology being positioned. Who decides how, where or what we teach.
        When tech is used with student well-being in mind, then technology can
        help students.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="strategies-engaged-get.html">Getting students engaged</a>:
          Student's complete attention is necessary for learning. Here are two
          strategies to trigger students’ initial cognitive processes. </li>
        <li><a href="strategies-engaged-maintain.html"> Maintaining Engagement</a>:
          During course activities, focused attention can be effected with clear
          structures, action based guidelines, challenging tasks and timely
          feedback. </li>
        <li><a href="strategies-engaged-re-engage.html">Re-engaging students </a>:
          A proportion of students will delay or fail to engage at key points
          during a course. Re-capturing their attention is possible with these
          two strategies; monitoring and personal attention.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>To Consider: Flipped Learning </h2>
      <p>The flipped classroom describes a logistical arrangement. It's about
        the how and when introductory information is processed by students. And
        then what is scheduled to take place in class. Flipped learning is about
        inverting the expectations around the traditional lecture.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="strategies-flipped.html">Flipped learning</a>: Flipping
          isn’t about lessons and homework. It's about helping students to
          unpack their understanding with dynamic and interactive group
          learning. At home and in the class. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>To Try: Backward Design</h2>
      <p>One way to challenge the content centered approach to curriculum design
        is to work backwards. This approach, known as backward design,
        prioritizes learning outcomes and meaningful assessment tasks. When you
        design backwards, you support contextualized teaching approaches. You
        guide students towards understanding. In backwards design, students can
        “show what they know” and digital scaffolding can help them “come to
        know”.</p>
      <p>Backwards designs asks lecturers to think about the END first, about
        the purpose of the course, not the content that needs to be covered. Its
        focus is on what a student should be able to accomplish, and what plans
        can be made to assist the students attain these accomplishments .</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="strategies-backwards.html">Backward design</a>:There are
          lecturers who begin their curriculum planning with the textbook.
          Backwards design advocates for the reverse. To first identify the
          desired results, then decide what constitutes acceptable evidence and
          finally plan the learning experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>To Do: Techno-teacher Checklist</h2>
      <p>Use the following checklist to identify your current use of technology
        and think about how you to use digital in the future. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="strategies-todo.html">Techno-teacher checklist</a>: Think
          about how you currently use technology and then go through this
          checklist to exploit the attributes of technology and enrich your
          lecturing or perhaps create better learning experiences</li>
      </ul>

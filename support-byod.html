                <h2>To Begin: BYOD (Bring your own device)</h2>
<p>       Widespread ownership of mobile devices among students means that many students will use them to connect, read, access and locate more data and information, complete tasks and support other personal learning needs. Their own (or perhaps shared) devices are a central pivot around which they organize their lives.</p> <p> Sometimes these devices are welcomed in class, other times they are a distraction </p> <p>
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)1 is
not about tech parity. Students’
devices differ in terms of hardware
specifications, software, connectivity,
carriage services or other technology
applications. BYOD is about supporting
student’s current digital skills and
developing greater fluency, so that
greater agency might develop. BYOD
also acknowledges the importance
of giving priority to student choice
and their voice. If it is used within
the constraints of the university’s
acceptable use policy (AUP) and the
users agree to be accountable to the
norms of a department/course/lecturer.
BYOD offers new flexibilities to the
hybrid course developer.
Recommendations regarding device
specifications, software and accessories
should not be prescribed globally to
all students. If there are minimum
expectations of BYOD devices, then
these should be negotiated in class.</p>
        
<h3>Pre-requisite Skills</h3> 
 <p>If BYOD use is encouraged, then a common skill set should not be assumed across the class. It needs to be ascertained if students can</p> 
<ul>
    <li>

        Install apps/programmes on their
device (if shared with others, such
as those in a library or computer
lab, it will typically not allow you to
install software);
</li><li> Save files (memory stick hard drive/
to the cloud) and retrieve them
later;
</li><li>Perform a web search and use a
web browser to navigate various
websites;
</li><li>Troubleshoot technology prior to
participating in any new activities;
</li><li>Configure their device to receive
important notifications;
</li><li>Access their student email address
or change their email address;
</li><li>Enter important dates into their
calendar and remind them when
deadlines are approaching.
    </li>    
        </ul>

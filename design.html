We’ve seen course packs written with
inappropriate font faces, confusing
layout, clashing colour schemes, and
			much text squeezed into a small space. They are filled with hyperlinks that lead nowhere, images that are irregularly shaped.</p>
<p>
We know students who’ve sat squinting
in the back of the lecture hall, unable
to view or comprehend PowerPoint
presentations. We’ve downloaded
PDF journal articles on our phone
screen and had to scroll backwards
	and forwards every line. We've followed instructions, clicked on a link, and then got distracted by rabit holes with multiple browser tabs.</p>
<h4>Accessible and usable</h4>			
<p>	Analogue materials have commonly
accepted conventions that are applied
to make them accessible, to help
	the reader find their way around.
Books have a preface and an index,
are divided by chapters, have page
numbers, importance is denoted by
different sized headings with different
weights. These conventions have
developed over centuries of book
production and help us understand
the hierarchical relationships between
elements.</p><p>
Digital materials also require
conventions to guide the reader
through their design. For example, the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG) provides a single set of shared
guidelines for web content accessibility.
Each of these guidelines has testable
criteria. Lecturers might think about
using a similar set of conventions,
such as Universal Design (UD) in their
hybrid courses. Those who share these
principles and adopt its guidelines will
contribute towards designing a learning
environment that is beneficial to the
widest range of students, including
those with disabilities, older users or
who cannot afford heavy data costs

				<p>We
acknowledge that a range of issues
(simplicity, ease of use, aesthetics, error
recovery, etc.) affect an online learning
experience. We think that with common
principles and proactive design, both
usability and accessibility may be
improved so that all students can
access learning resources and learn in
a satisfactory manner</p>
<blockquote>I try to begin with the assumption
that all students’ learning landscape is
uneven and not as level as mine. I ask
myself, how can my course materials
be designed for all? Especially since
many students’ studies are mediated
	by mobile devices. </blockquote>

        <h2>To Begin: This way please </h2>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="design-hyperlink.HTML">Humble hyperlink</a>: A  web link or simply a link can be found on a webpage or document. When activated, the link redirects the reader to another location, such as a new web page. The hyperlink is at the heart of digital learning, and it comes in different  forms. “Click here” is one of the most common phrases used to indicate to
the reader to act on the hyperlink.
        </ul>
        
        <h2>To Consider: Acess that is inclusive</h2>
        <ul><li><a href="design-UID.html">Universal Instructional Design</a>: When designing courses, technologies or services, the designer usually targets the “average” user, and
then additional accommodations for differently abled students are added subsequently. Universal Instructional Design (UID) takes a different approach to the many variables facing the course designer</li></ul>
        <h2>To Try: Sequence and Flow</h2>
        
        <ul><li><a href="design-scanning.html">Easy scanning</a>: Content should be arranged in a logical sequence and allow the eye to flow through it without additional effort. Using an organising scheme, headings and subheadings, and lists to organise content allows students to clearly see how the main concepts are related.</li>
            
         <li><a href="design-text.html">Text alternatives</a>Rich delivery format (images, video, audio)enriches the delivery of a course. But it also might hinder access for to  those who cannot afford the higher costs associated with the use of multi media media.
</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>To Do: Presentation Do's and Don'ts </h2>
        <ul><li><a href="design-todo.HTML">Evaluate your own PowerPoint</a>: We have all been exposed to a bad PowerPoint presentation. By keeping in mind a few guidelines,
you will prevent several recurring design
errors. Use this example rubric to plan,
develop and evaluate the PowerPoint
presentations you use in class</ul>

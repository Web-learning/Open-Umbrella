<h2>To Consider - Syllabus</h2>
        
        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions </h3>
       <p>A course outline (or syllabus)  is a useful way to pre-empt common problems that might occur during a course.  But a syllabus is often glossed over by inexperienced students because it overwhelming and seems meaningless.
</p>
        <p>Syllabus bloat” is a result of putting
too much information into a course
upfront.</p>
        <p>Common questions and standard
answers is the primary way of
helping students get the intended
information as quick as possible.
This kind of information is known as
a FAQ (frequently asked questions),
but can also be called “Help Desk” or
“Tips and Tricks”. A good FAQ should
allow students to go to the immediate
question (thus saving time) and receive
a consistent answer.</p>
        <p>FAQ needs to guide and inform the student information needs. Here are five tips to creating an
effective FAQ:
<ul><li>Find current problems that students are facing and re-frame these questions as your headings.</li>
<li>Ensure that questions have a specific focus (write in second person, not third or first).</li>
<li> Make the tone engaging, but don’t sound like a salesperson.</li>
        <li>Arrange alphabetically and be consistent with your style (format, highlighting, bullets) so they are easily
            scanned.</li>
    <li>Segment the FAQ by audience or type of question.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p class="drop-cap"> If such a student is to feel a part of an online
            learning community then conversational type of communication is a
            good idea. Dialogue makes it easier for people to participate.
            However, it takes time and practice to become technically proficient
            at utilizing the capabilities of media and medium. The pressure to
            be technically competent tends to eclipse any attempts at real
            connection. This is true for academics as well as students. </p>
          <p>No matter what communication devices, media and apps they have at
            their fingertips, all parties can be reticent or removed from the
            interactions that are offered in a digital teaching and learning
            environment. </p>
          <p>Whether in class or online, it is important to establish norms of
            communication with students. The language you choose to use reflects
            your expectations of students, and to how they should interact with
            you, the course, and their peers in the online environment. </p>
          <p> The screen can become becomes a barrier and not a mechanism for
            interactions between all the class participants. Students may not
            readily translate face-to-face classroom “norms” to the online
            format. A common reaction to silence would be to berate those who
            lurk and remain on the periphery. Or to cajole them into
            participation while mentioning the consequences of absence. As the
            term progresses, mounting time pressures makes even more difficult
            to attend to passive students. </p>
          <p> Setting, clearly communicating, and modelling your expectations
            from the start will help your students (and you) build in care and
            connections. Below are examples of different ways to design
            communication and build community into your class. Feel free to cut
            and paste any of these elements directly into your course and then
            customize where necessary. </p>

          <blockquote> I’ve seen how the combination of f2f and online allows my
            students to feel more connected to me, their peers and their
            studies. </blockquote>
          <h3>Office Hours</h3>
          <p> Dedicated time set aside for a one-to-one with a lecturer is
            commonly called “office hours”. This is the opportunity for students
            to share whats on their minds, and for an academic, who is teaching
            them, to listen.</p>
          <p> During office hours, I will be available in person / via Zoom on
            ____ from ____ to ____. If you need to schedule a time to chat
            outside these days/times please email me directly. You will have
            also have ongoing access to me (and your peers) during the course.
            My primary form of communication is [Email | Twitter | WhatsApp].
            Messages to [Email | Twitter | WhatsApp]. will be checked daily
            during the week. I will do my best to respond to questions within 24
            hours or, if sent on the weekend, the following Monday. </p>

          <p>We notice the quieter student who does not like the spotlight, is
            reserved and prefers to keep their own counsel. We don’t want to
            belittle anyone or embarrass them. We think that in a hybrid
            environment, interactions can be both immediate and timely or
            asynchronous and considered. If care and connections are built into
            the fabric of a course, then we can interpret and attend to silent
            and loud voices.</p>

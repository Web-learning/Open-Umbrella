        <h2>To Try: Easy Scanning</h2>
        <p>Content should be arranged in a manner so it has a logical flow. Using an organizing scheme, headings, and subheadings and lists to organize content allows students to clearly see how the main concepts are related. </p>
        
        <p>An explicit organising scheme allows students to find what they are
looking for. Wurman (1989) suggests
that there are five organisational
schemes around which information
can be arranged. He called these
schemes the five hat racks. They are
category (similarity relatedness), time
(chronological sequence), location
(geography or spatial references),
writing system (alphabet) and
continuum (magnitude, highest to
lowest, best to worst).</p><p>
Headings are visual references to
indicate the hierarchy and structure of
a document. They help the reader to
identify the hierarchical structure of a
document (e.g., sections, sub-sections).
Headings provide a visual cue that lead
sighted readers to quickly navigate
through sections of a document,
skimming through content until they
find a section they are looking for.</p><p>
When creating headings, many change
the font, enlarge the size and select
bold type, thus creating the impression
of a heading. Rather than using visual
cues for headings, make use of the
underlying code or stylesheets within
a program so that screen reader users
can also benefit from the headings.</p><p>
In a Microsoft Word document, use the
style sheet to create your headings.
In your LMS, also use the formatting
styles available to create headings and
subheadings. If you know how to use
HTML, use the tags that denote the
headings: ranked h1 through h6.
        </p><p>
This approach prevents screen readers
from just “reading” through the text of
a heading as if it were part of another
paragraph of content and missing
intended cues about structure and
organisation.</p><p>
When correct conventions are used,
then screen reader users can navigate
a page according to its headings.
The “reader” can listen to a list of all
headings, and skip to a desired heading
and begin reading from that point.</p><p>
Lists come in two forms i.e. ordered (1,
2, 3…) and unordered lists (bulleted).</p><p>
These lists make it easy to show
hierarchies of information in a
similar way to using heading levels.
It is important that lists are created
using structure provided by the word
processor or content editor you use,
and that logical nesting is used. It’s
good practice not to use asterisks,
        custom symbols, or tabs to create lists.</p>

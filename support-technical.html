                <h2>To Try: Getting Technical  </h2>

<h3>Technical Guidelines</h3> 
<p>Connected learning can become very frustrating if there are challenges that prevent students from making effective use of the digital resources.  SO, before the course begins, set the following task to help students to determine whether the are able to meet the technical requirements before they start the course. </p>
        <p>Below are two practical assignments that can be set for students in the initial week of a course. If students can complete these
assignments, then the lecturer can assume a certain level of competency .</p>
<h4>Files and folders</h4> 
<p>Much of the work that we do on a
computer involves files and folders.
Please open up your file manager
and complete the following task.</p>
<ol>
<li>    
        Create a folder entitled
ASSIGNMENTS
</li><li>Download the study guide file
and look for information about
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
</li><li>Copy and paste ACADEMIC
INTEGRITY statements into a word
processor
</li><li>Save the file with the academic
integrity information into the folder
ASSIGNMENTS
</li><li>Open and read the syllabus file
and see how many assignments
are due
</li><li>Create a copy of the academic
integrity file for each assignment due
</li><li>Add the due date to each folder
</li><li>Select a sequence of folders or files
</li><li>Zip these files and upload them to the cloud
</li><li>Share the link with your teacher
    </li>
        </ol>        
<h4>Example 2: Defaults and settings</h4>
     <p>To avoid frustrating delays when using the LMS, you will need to be prepared beforehand. Taking a few basic technical actions, like installing new software or  configuring your browser  settings,  early on in the semester will save you from unnecessary headaches.   </p>
        <p>ClickUP is compatible with most web
browsers, but to be safe, please make
sure that you are using a recently
updated browser such as Firefox,
Chrome or Opera. You will be expected
to watch, listen or respond to different
kinds of media. You will find it useful to
have earphones to listen to multimedia
elements without disturbing your
neighbours. Before the course begins,
we will work together to check whether
the following technical requirements
are met before you start this course:
</p>
        
    <ul>
    <li>I have internet access and can
access the LMS.
        </li><li>I have an appropriate computing
device with an up to date browser
with necessary plugins and
software installed.
</li><li>I know what to do if I have a tech
emergency.</li>    
        
        </ul>

          <p class="drop-cap">We realize that the equivalent of a
            library sits in the palm of student’s
            hands. We are beginning to see the
            associated cognitive burdens and costs
            that certain students have to bare when
            given access to a wealth of information. </p>
          <h4>Become a curator</h4>
          <p>“Curators” aim to create a
            buffer between over-abundance of
            information and our working memory.
            Online curation tools allow an academic
            to put selected content into a context,
            organise and annotate the information
            and then share it with students.</p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p> We believe that curation tools offer
            lecturers and students a means to
            collect critical and up-to-date works,
            a hub from where these seminal and
            supplementary work can be accessed, and an order or sequence.</p>
          <p>
            When curation is associated with Open
            Education Resources (OER), content
            becomes available at lower costs.
            Students are offered a richer media
            experience and begin to see where they
            have come from and where they are
            expected to go.</p>

          <h4>Copyright</h4>
          <p> Academics need to be aware of
            copyright and licensing status on all
            materials used in their courses. OERs
            are educational materials that either
            have an open licence (like creative
            commons) or reside in the public
            domain. OERs can be legally used,
            adapted and reshared at little to no
            cost, thus allowing students access to
            up-to-date, relevant and accessible
            subject material.</p>
          <blockquote>I see how students become
            overwhelmed with information. Their
            attention is affected by this cognitive
            load. I’ve taken to curating my course
            materials. Information is arranged
            and tagged according to date, unit or
            subject.</blockquote>

      <h2>To Begin: Content Inventory</h2>
      <p>
        As a preparation step for putting a
        course online, it is useful to locate and
        think about course-related information
        and activities that will be useful or
        required for this course.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="content-inventory.html"> Content Inventory</a>: This matrix
          will help you Locate and think about course relateed information using
          a</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>To Consider: Steps towards openness </h2>
      <p>Open Education Resources offer a tripple play. They combine the
        convenience of digital, affordable and customisable. With
        an open textbook, the lecturer can
        distribute textbooks easiliy and at a low cost and apply different
        tools, (such as annotation tools) so that books are read
        actively.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open Textbooks</li>
        <li>Open Education Resources</li>
        <li><a href="content-licenses.html">Open Licenses</a>: Works that are
          published are, by
          default, protected by copyright law,
          although they will not always display
          the familiar © to draw your attention
          to this. If the published resource has
          an open licence associated with it, then
          you can assume that it is an OER. If it
          does not, it means, unfortunately, that
          it is most likely protected by copyright
          law, so copying it is illegal.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>To Try: Content Curation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="content-curation.html">Curation tools and resources</a>
          allow you to collect, arrange and tag resources in a manner that makes
          sense to the curator</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>To Do: Posting Content</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="content-todo.html">Content Release Checklist</a>:It is
          tempting to post content immediately online. But if students are to
          manage the subject matter (and not be overwhelmed by it) then it is
          important to find, sequence and arrange the content of your course
          before it gets posted onto the LMS.</li>

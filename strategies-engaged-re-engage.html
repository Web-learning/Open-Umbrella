                <h2>To Begin: Re-engaging students</h2>
    
        <h3>Re-entering the cognitive process</h3>
<p>In most courses a proportion of students will delay or fail to engage at the start of the course, or stop engaging during the semester, usually at key points such as assessment. The literature identifies two critical strategies for re-capturing the engagement of these students</p>
        <ol><li>Monitoring and early identification: Fewer contact moments within a class mean that students are more likely to disengage or fail to re-engage. Recovering the attention of these students is possible with a specific call to action, which can then be recorded on the LMS 	
</li><li>Personal contact and negotiated conditions for re-engagement: The most effective strategy for re-engaging students is personal contact by the teacher. Such contact works best when the teacher works with the student to provide help and support</li></ol>
	
	 <p>Privacy and data protection issues need to be weighed against the desire to monitor progress. Apps or services that require teachers and students to supply personal information to a third-party service should be avoided </p>
        
<p>	Teaching presence can be enhanced by using tools that allow for facilitation and feedback. If the tool allows for customisation, then it can fit the class context and the intended learning outcomes

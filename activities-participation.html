        <h3>Participation Expectations</h3>
   <p>
    Participation in a f2f class is a vital part of the learning process, hence the
    focus on attendance and registers. In class, the participation can take
    many forms. They range from open ended questions intended to focus the
    whole class’ attention on a big idea, to group projects where teams are led
    through an investigation that demands complex reasoning or problem solving,
    to one on one question and answer conversations before and after the
    lecture.
</p>
        <table><tr><td>Students are required to login and “attend” as their presence is necessary precondition.</td><td>Participation is optional and students judge the required levels of student participation for themselves.</td><td>I have a rubric that provides a sequence of criteria by which my students can judge their participation.</td></tr></table>
<p>
    The same kind of face to face participation should not be replicated in the
    online portion of a hybrid course, and rightly so. But it is probably
    necessary to define what constitutes as participation; one to one messages
    or substantive dialogue that builds upon posts and responses? And then use
    different mechanisms to promote interaction.
</p>
<p>
    Below is a sample syllabus communication and engagement policy for a hybrid
    course, which communicates an expectation for participation upfront.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        This is a hybrid course and the class is arranged into weekly units. We
        meet face to face in class every alternate week and the other portion
        of the class takes place online (the dates during which we meet face to
        face are clearly indicated in bold font on the syllabus schedule).
        Attendance at the face to face classes and regular participation
        (whether in class or online activities) is required.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Whether we are meeting face to face or working online, you will be
        expected to go online to continue discussion or complete other
        activities. Your participation is measured by how much you engage with
        peers and the lecturer in synchronous and asynchronous discussions.
    </em>

    <em>
        See the Participation Rubric to clarify criteria and expectations.

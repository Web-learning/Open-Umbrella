          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <h2>Welcome to the Open Umbrella</h2>
          <p> The “open umbrella” is a professional learning project. The
            umbrella offers a lecturer or teacher many self-defined entry points
            for improving their courses. Whether teaching remotely, on campus or
            in a hybrid space, the "umbrella" focuses attention upon evidence
            informed practices. These practices, when thoughtfully applied when
            technology is incorporated into their course, create openness.&nbsp;
            The "open umbrella" consists of three parts <br>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Self Evaluation Tool &amp; </li>
            <li>Hybrid Learning Field Guide</li>
            <li>Hypothes.is annotations.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The "open umbrella" then acts both an instrument that can note
            current levels of implementation, a collection of ideas to consider,
            practical activities to try and checklists for implementation. And
            as a place for social annotations.&nbsp; </p>
          <ol>
          </ol>
          <h3>Why an umbrella </h3>
          <p>The "open umbrella" identifies eight panels (or practice areas)
            that contribute towards a quality online education experience. This
            multi-pronged approach is presented as separate elements which are
            arranged next to each other, as if they were a part of an unfurled
            brolly, hence the open umbrella. The core panels or elements
            are&nbsp; </p>
          <ol>
            <li><a href="assessment.html">Assessment</a></li>
            <li> <a href="strategies.html"> Teaching and learning strategies</a></li>
            <li><a href="activities.html">Learning activities</a></li>
            <li><a href="content.html">Content</a></li>
            <li><a href="communication.html">Communication</a></li>
            <li> <a href="administration.html">Administration</a></li>
            <li><a href="design.html">Design</a> </li>
            <li> <a href="support.html">Support Strategies</a></li>
          </ol>
          <p> Each of the eight panels introduce statements, opinions or
            evidence that should provoke, trouble or prompt the reader to
            consider their current approaches to incorporating technology into
            their course. And respond. </p>
          <h3>Self Evaluation Tool</h3>
          <p>The <a href="https://eduvation.up.ac.za/apps/blended/">Umbrella
              Application</a> (App) is hosted at Pretoria University. This app
            is a self assessment tool that repeats the eight different panels of
            an umbrellas. At present, the app has been designed for a university
            setting and supports a particular strategy. Academics can consult
            the eight dimensions within the app and use this structure to </p>
          <ul>
            <li>record existing practices;</li>
            <li> self-identify features of their course within the eight
              categories; and </li>
            <li> create a record of the current practices to be used as
              benchmarks for future reference</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This app is designed to prompt reflection on a current course.
            After working through the app’s eight dimensions and identifying the
            types of implementation, a picture of the width and depth of digital
            adoption, in the form of coloured panels set into the umbrella, will
            emerge. </p>
          <h3>Hybrid Learning Field Guide </h3>
          <p>The Hybrid Learning Field Guide complements the Umbrella App.
            Firstly, it identifies a variety of digital education practices
            commonly found in tertiary hybrid or blended learning environments.
            Next, it arranges them across the eight dimensions, followed by a
            selection of bite-sized suggestions to support professional
            development. </p>
          <h3>Suggested Use</h3>
          <p>This is a buffet of digital education practices. You can pick and
            choose from the feast. I hope that this is an opportunity for
            digital education to flourish. You might use the instrument within
            your department for accountability and performance purposes. And
            then consult the field guide to focus improving identified elements
            in your course. The resources collected under each element can be
            used and modified according to an institution’s capacity or
            immediate needs. If you want to be pro-active and look ahead, then
            you can use the whole package informally and enhance your online
            course resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          <p>If you are in the position to be an agent of educational change and
            are prepared to take manageable steps towards the enhancement and
            development of courses while using digital means, then you may want
            to consult with the developers of the "open umbrella" and the
            authors of the field guide (see the bottom of the page).&nbsp; </p>

          <h3>Background </h3>
          <p>The Open Umbrella is based on a framework developed by the
            Department for Education Innovation at Pretoria University after
            shut campus down across South Africa in 2015. Wendy Kilfoil and
            Detken Scheepers initiated the guide with Derek Moore as we all
            became aware of the increased technology. Estelle Drysdale created
            the app.</p>

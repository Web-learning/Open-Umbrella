                <h2>To Begin: Minimum levels </h2>
    <p>Technologies have always promised quicker routes to access education. Navigating these roads, for some, is easy. The pathways are familiar and well worn. For others, the technology is daunting and students feel inadequate for the journey. Still for others, technology is the only viable trail available. No matter what the experience of the route, it’s important to allow students to self- identify where they
are on route</p>
        <h3>
    What level are you at? 
</h3>
    <p>It doesn’t matter what level you are
at, we believe that anyone who uses
technology to support their work, their
study, or other aspects of living in a
digital age can move forward. Please
use the following criteria and rubric to identify
where you are at present in terms
of access, experience and trouble
shooting skills.</p>
<ul><li>Unfamiliar – I do not use
technology much and probably
need some assistance
</li><li>Competent - I know about the
basics, but I’m not very advanced.
I’m not always aware of what is
going on, but can work it out
</li><li>Comfortable – I can use quite
a number of different tools
and packages. I use technology
routinely and am aware of how
things work
</li><li>Confident – I am very familiar with
these technologies and can resolve
most problems or issues. I also
help others and solve their tech
    problems.</li></ul>   
        
        

<p>
 Can you identify where you are at present in
    terms of access and skills?

                <h2>To Begin: Getting Started </h2>

        <h3>At the beginning of the
course</h3>
<p>To access and participate in a connected 
    course, you will to login. But logins are not always a straightforward process.</p>
    <h4>What should I do if my
user name and password is not recognized?</h4>
        <p>You can do two things:</p>
<ol><li>Remember passwords are case
sensitive. Make sure that you are entering your passwords in upper or lower case (capitals or no capitals)  </li>
<li> On the login screen to the UP
portal you can create/change your
password <ul>
<li>If you are logging in for
the first time, click on the
New users link. The system
will take you through the
steps for creating security
questions and to set up your
password. Read the steps and
information (on passwords
and browsers) carefully.
</li><li>If you forgot your password,
use the Lost (forgotten)
password link to create a new
    one.</li></ul></li>
<li>If the above two methods do not
solve your problem, contact the
Student Help Desk.</li></ol>
<h3>
        If things don’t work as
expected</h3>
<p>Make sure that you are using the
correct browser, e.g. Mozilla Firefox or
Google Chrome (latest versions). Do
NOT use Internet Explorer.</p>
<ul>        
<li>Pop-ups are enabled
Sometimes when you click on a
link, the LMS should open a smaller
pop-up window. But if pop-up
blocking software or pop-up
blocking features are enabled in
your browser, then you won’t be
able to view these pop ups while
using the LMS.
</li><li>Cookies are enabled
the LMS uses cookies to remember
who you are when you move from
page to page across the site. When
you login, a cookie is created, when
you log out or close the browser
this cookie is destroyed.
</li><li>Java/script is optional
It is not necessary to have
JavaScript enabled on the LMS
    </li>
    </ul>
        <h3>In case of emergency</h3>
        <p>There are a range of events that are
beyond your control, including an
electricity outage, a stolen computer,
a crashed course that is unexpectedly
down, weak internet connections and
computers infected by a virus.<br/>It pays to take precautions.</p>
<ul><li>
    When composing a considered
response for your blog, social
media, or discussion board it might
be good idea to compose these
thoughts first in a word processing
software, save it, and then copy
and paste your work online.
</li><li>Keep your files organised in folders
by class, and within those folders
by units of the class. Your work
will quickly pile up; establishing
a system for easily locating
materials you’ve produced for your
coursework is immensely valuable.
</li><li>Regularly back up your files to an
external drive or cloud storage.
</li><li>If you are using technologies for
the first time, schedule additional
time to become familiar with those
technologies.
    
    </li>

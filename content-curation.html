        <p>
    There are is a wide range of digital sources of information. Online
    curation resources, such Popplet, folder structure on your computer,
    Pinterest etc. allow you to manage this information. You can use them to
    collect a range of resources under a certain topic, organise or tag them in
    a manner that makes sense to the curator, reflect on their usefulness and
    share them with others.
</p>
<p>
    If you have not already done so, create an account for a curation tool. Use
    the selected tool to manage the different digital sources of information.
    Then start collecting resources, organise them, reflect on them and share
    them. It is important to not forget the social aspect of these curation
    tools. Although you might prefer to work alone, together in a team you can
    curate and build a collaborative list of useful resources that you can
    consult together with your peers.
</p>
<p>
    Link appropriate sources within your curation tool to the particular LMS
    course you want to use it in or find a way to export it. Then the LMS
    becomes the curation tool for your course.

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p class="drop-cap">You walk into a room and see students huddled
            together in small group discussions. The lecturer stops them after
            about a minute, calling randomly on several individuals for
            responses; getting more responses from volunteers; and then
            proceeding with their lecture. </p>
          <p>Or you login to the LMS and notice discussion board notifications.
            There you discover that students have posted their opinions and
            thoughts to your discussion question. Your also recognize that these
            ideas would probably not have been shared in a face to face setting.
            You enquire further in an online dialogue. The whole posting process
            takes each individual a few minutes. But so many more students have
            participated and are actively engaged in discussions about the
            topic.</p>
          <p> Active learning, either in the form of in-class interactions or
            online activities or tasks, are useful to activate students’ prior
            knowledge, motivate them to take action and help bridge ideas from
            familiar concrete contexts to an abstract concept. When technologies
            are used to support smaller groups, discussion, interaction, then
            these tools offer new levers to enable greater participation by a
            wider selection of students.</p>
          <h3>Learning activity guidelines</h3>
          <p>If you are experienced with active learning, then you might "wing
            it" in front of a class in a lecture hall. But when online, the
            mechanics for fostering interaction and dialogue between remote
            students needs to be considered beforehand. </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fit for purpose</strong>: the activity that has been
              selected matches the learning outcomes while also being aware of
              the technical challenges a user might face. </li>
            <li> <strong>Visual aids</strong>: the images that are used with
              the learning activity are clear and engaging. They prompt
              participation and communicate the need for engagement with others</li>
            <li> <strong>Instructions</strong>: a clear and concise sequence of
              steps or directions are written up to introduce the learning
              activity to participants. The instructions also include steps that
              offer support to common issues and anticipates some of the
              potential roadblocks that might affect the user.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <blockquote>I have high expectations about participation. My students
            are more than spectators. Listening to me and taking notes is only a
            beginning point. I’m looking for new opportunities for students to
            respond to each other and with me. I set “doing” tasks that make
            participation possible, even in a big class. You don’t actually
            learn until you engage.</blockquote>
          <p>We see the student who has a tendency towards passive learning. We
            know that conceptual development occurs when students choose to
            participate and interact. We want to widen the scope for engaging
            learning activities within a formal classroom or lecture theatre and
            beyond.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <p>Student-centered activities can be deployed anywhere, in a lecture
            hall, online or in a lab. Technology that supports an active
            approach to learning will allow students to make meaning with
            others. </p>

      <h2>To Begin: Modular Structures</h2>
      <p>A hybrid course is usually divided into multiple units. Each unit
        contains course materials, learning activities, assignments, and
        assessments for that unit. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="activities-modular.html">Modular structures</a>: A modular
          architecture offers the course designer with more options. Smaller
          components of a course allows the off campus student to see how the
          elements fit together and offers them a structure for navigating their
          way around a course. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>To Try: Interaction Mechanisms</h2>
      <p>In class or online, participation can take many forms. They range from
        open ended questions intended to focus the whole class’ attention on a
        big idea, to group projects where teams are led through an investigation
        that demands complex reasoning or problem solving, to one on one
        question and answer conversations before and after the lecture.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="activities-participation.html">Participation Rubric</a>:
          Students should be expected to be involved in their learning, whether
          face to face (f2f) or online. This participation rubric can help to
          clarify interaction expectations. </li>
        <li><a href="activities-conference.html">Synchronous conferencing</a>:
          At first glance, a synchronous tool offers a possible alternative to
          face to face conversations or lecture. With these tools, a lecturer
          can reach out beyond campus and connect to students and deliver a
          course without physically comming together. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>To Consider: Learning Activities that Promote "Participation"</h2>
      <p>Active learning is an accepted method for engaging students in what
        they are learning. As a pedagogical strategy, active learning will
        differ in class (synchronous and f2f) and digital (asynchronous online
        learning environments) settings. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="activities-muddiest.html">Muddiest Point:</a> This activity
          asks students to jot down a quick response to the question What was
          the muddiest point in _______? The purpose is to provide information
          about what students find most confusing in a unit or topic.</li>
        <li><a href="activities-minute.html">Minute Paper:</a> This writing
          activity is not an assessment or for recall. It’s for students to
          “identify the most important point they leaned today” and “what key
          questions remain unanswered” and then to share their responses.</li>
        <li><a href="activities-think.html">Think-Pair-Share:</a> This short
          learning activity offers students time and structure for thinking on a
          given topic, enabling them to formulate individual ideas and share
          these ideas with a peer. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>To Do: Using Learning Activities </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="activities-todo.html">Decision Making Checklist</a>: a
          lecturer will need to consider how learning activities can be
          structured and arranged within a hybrid course. This checklist offers
          points for them to consider. </li>

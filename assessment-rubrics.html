      <h2>To Try: Sign-post or Guide&nbsp; </h2>
      <p>Repubrics that use decriptive criteria offer students an opportunity to practice and develop their own
        evaluative judgments. The criteria that is included in a rubric can act as a sign-post or a guide for students. A descriptive rubric identifies identify various dimensions for quality and provides a sequence of possible criteria along a continuum within a specific dimension.</p>
		<p>Rubrics can be developed to accompany an essay, a
        presentation, lab work, forum contribution or final projects. When online, a rubric can be hyper linked with an assessment task, so that students can access and see the criteria upon which they will be assessed. </p>
      <p> Holistic use of a rubric is valuable because of the further conversations they enable. When rubrics are shared with a class, they offer students a </p>
      <ul>
        <li>set of concise and dependable dimensions (e.g. clarity, evidence,
          logic) that will be assessed.</li>
        <li>
          clear and thought through set of criteria for each dimension (e.g.
          clear and unambiguous evidence is presented) </li>
        <li>
          convenient and familiar format for reading and storing expectations</li>
        <li>
          quality or performance scale with each dimension </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Three steps to construct a rubric</h3>
      <h4>Step 1. Generate potential dimensions</h4>
      <p>This first step is the most important. It's what distinguishes a rubric
        from a traditional mark. Students are usually given a single numeric
        score or letter as evaluation of their work. By carefully choosing a
        number of dimensions to evaluate, expectations are clearer and our
        feedback is much more helpful</p>
      <p>Begin by looking at your course outcomes and identify some of the
        criteria that you expect them to demonstrate. Work your way through the
        table below and jot down the names of dimensions that might make sense
        as part of your rubric.</p>

      <h4>Step 2: Select a reasonable number of criteria
      </h4>
      <p>In Step 1, you might have listed more dimensions than you really need,
        so now it's time to weed it down. </p>
      <p>
        How many dimensions? Some say that a rubric should fit on one printed
        page. Others say that 4 to 8 dimensions is about right. There's no one
        correct answer, but it might help if you consider your purpose for this
        measurement. If it's diagnostic and formative, err on the side of more
        dimensions rather than fewer. If you just want to be able to give a
        summative evaluation of your students' performance for this particular
        lesson, then use fewer dimensions as it makes marking easier. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask yourself what the most important aspects of this task are and
          rank your dimensions from most important to least.</li>
        <li>
          Eliminate those dimensions that are at the bottom of your list until
          you've determined the most important 4 to 8 dimensions.</li>
        <li>
          Write those remaining dimensions in the leftmost column </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Step 3: Write Benchmark Descriptions
      </h4>
      <p>Now think about each dimension. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What would a superb example of each dimension look like? Describe in
          succinctly and clearly and write each description in the rightmost
          column of the rubric.</li>
        <li>
          What would a poor example of the dimension look like. Look at your
          superb description and write a contrasting description in the leftmost
          column of the rubric</li>
        <li>
          Then fill out the next column or two until you've got each cell of the
          matrix filled.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Developing a rubric might seem like a lot of work. But making the
        dimensions and criteria clear upfront will </p>
      <ul>
        <li>save time when marking</li>
        <li> make that process more consistent and fair</li>
        <li>
          communicate your expectations to students</li>
        <li>
          help you to decide what and how to teach</li>
        <li>
          help students understand how their work is graded</li>
      </ul>

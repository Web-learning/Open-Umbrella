      <h2>To Begin: Arrange Key Texts</h2>
      Attempt the following steps to sort and manage your course-related content
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li> Identify an explicit organising scheme which you will arrange the
          content (e.g. units, modules, topics, themes etc) </li>
        <li> Create a folder structure on your computer that corresponds to your
          explicit organizing scheme. Use a common folder naming convention </li>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li> <strong>snake case</strong> is the practice of writing compound
            words or phrases in which the elements are separated with one
            underscore character (_) and no spaces e.g. Unit_1_basketweaving. </li>
          <li> <strong>camel case </strong> is the practice of capitalising
            the first letter of each word in a series and then removing spaces,
            numbers, underscores, hyphens, and other special characters, e.g.
            UnitOneBasketWeaving. </li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p> But DON'T file anything away yet </p>
      <ol start="3" type="1">
        <li> Identify different types of resources that you will expect students
          to draw on as they complete course activities and assessment, e.g.: </li>
        <ul >
          <li> textbook chapter </li>
          <li> webpage </li>
          <li> chapter / section of a web document </li>
          <li> article from an online periodical </li>
          <li> online scholarly journal article </li>
          <li> article from disciplinary and professional associations </li>
          <li> newspaper article </li>
          <li> electronic books </li>
          <li> encyclopaedias and dictionaries </li>
          <li> data sets </li>
          <li> multi media (video, audio) </li>
          <li> graphic data (e.g. interactive maps and other graphic
            representations of data) </li>
          <li> online book chapter </li>
          <li> blog </li>
          <li> forum or discussion post </li>
          <li> wiki </li>
        </ul>
        <li> Divide the resources into: </li>
      </ol>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li> seminal resources </li>
        <li> supplementary resources </li>
        <li> Maybe useful resources </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> Rename these resources using a common convention (remember camel or
          snake case): </li>
      </ul>
      <ol start="5" type="2">
        <li> Look at the seminal resources and craft descriptions that provides
          meaningful details necessary to guide students relying for all these
          resources. The description can be short (two or three lines), contain
          instructions about how students should approach it (watch the video
          through once, then read chapter two in your textbook and watch it
          again), offer a time frame for use and describe what you expect
          students to learn by interacting with it. </li>
        <li> Be sure to check that these seminal resources can be aligned with
          course outcomes </li>
        <li> Place you can go ahead and file these seminal resources within the
          folder structure that you created in Step 2. </li>
        <li> Draw a sitemap that visalizes the organizing scheme for content.
          Print this out, it will help you later as you create learning
          activities and assessments </li>
        <li> Decide if and where you want to file the supplementary and other
          resources </li>
      </ol>
      <p> Once you have completed these steps, you should have most of your
        content. </p>

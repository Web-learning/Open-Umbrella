        <h2>To Begin: The humble hyperlink </h2>   
<p>A hyperlink, web link or simply a link can be found on a webpage or document. When activated, the link
redirects the reader to another location, such as a new web page. These redirect statements allow the
reader to choose their own path to follow. By clicking or tapping on a highlighted word or image on the
screen, they are “transported” to a new place.</p>
        <p>The hyperlink is at the heart of digital
learning, and it comes in different
forms. “Click here” is one of the most
common phrases used to indicate to
the reader to act on the hyperlink.
It’s intended to call a user to perform
an “action”. But “click here” can be
meaningless when there are lots of
hyperlinks included in a page. “Click”
alludes to the mechanics of a mouse.
Not all students are using a mouse or
other “clicking” devices to navigate the
links displayed on your course pages.
Many are on a touch screen. “Here” is
irrelevant for students using assistive
devices, such as screen readers. Links
need to clearly explain where they are
taking users, and should be described
by using concrete nouns or action
verbs.</p>
        <p>For example, instead of “click here”
to create a link to a reading, the
hyperlink can be assigned directly to
the words “download chapter two”.
When creating a hyperlink, use action
verbs to reinforce the message that
students’ online actions are a part of
their learning pathway. “Download,
read and summarise chapter two in your
accountancy textbook” provides more
information and more clearly directs
            them to an action required.</p>
        <p>
Links can be accompanied by hidden
text that describes the topic or purpose
of the link. When screen readers are
used, the hidden text describes the
purpose of the link on a the page. As
such, the hidden link text must describe
the content of the link when taken</p>
<h3>Embedding resources within a page</h3>
        <p>
You will have noticed that for
some sites, it is unnecessary to
click on a hyperlink to jump to
another resource and load it as
a separate page. This is because
the resources are embedded in
the page. As a course designer,
you might not want students
to go elsewhere. Resources
(video, audio, PDF etc) can be
embedded within a page. With
an <iframe> tag, video (and
other kinds of media) can be
incorporated into a course
page and brings interest and
movement to a static page.</p>

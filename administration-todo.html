<h3>Course home page tips:</h3> 
<ul><li>A course distinguishes itself administratively with a unique code. But the title is what students remember.  To help their retention, repeat the course code and title in subsequent headings in the home page</li>
    <li>
Course information needs to appear on the course home page. It can also be “packaged” in a manner so that it is available for students to download and saved, preferably when they are in a free Wi-Fi zone.  The main reason for making the course home page down-loadable is that students student’s can access key information from a remote location, where Wi-Fi is not always available.
    </li><li>
Prompt students to become responsible for their own time management. Make milestones across a whole course explicit and then include these milestones as an iCal file for them to  download to their phone calendars.</li></ul>

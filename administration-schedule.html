      <h2>To Try - Time management</h2>
      <h3>Time and Schedules</h3>
      <p>One of the more complex challenges associated with digital, is managing
        the many
        competing and shifting priorities. A “course schedule” or “course
        calendar” is a staple element of
        any course. Whether f2f, remote or blended.</p>
      <p>
        If class are only face to face, a calendar allows students to see when
        they need to arrive at the venue (lecture hall, classroom or lab)
        or&nbsp; and how long the schedule session will take.</p>
      <p>Off campus students do not have the luxury of dedicated study time and
        are required to juggle conflicting priorities (school, family, children,
        work). Students, because of their location, have to make more decisions
        about attention. Although studying remotely might have the benefit of
        making studying more flexible, students own time management requires
        explicit support, especially if they are unfamiliar with being a
        self-directed student, struggle.</p>
      <p>Scheduling becomes an acute issue in a hybrid course where online
        activities are required to be completed between the face-to-face
        classes. In the hybrid setting, especially when learning behind a screen
        and in face to face classes, there is a greater need to make the
        sequence and completion of&nbsp; course-related events apparent to all
        members of a course. This includes lecturer availability; due dates for
        activities, such as quizzes, assignment dates, dates and times for
        face-to-face sessions; and (if you are going to meet synchronously)
        online meeting times.</p>
      <p>Below are a few tips on scheduling and communicating clear, time
        specific teaching and learning events, so that all students, whether on
        campus, remote or shifting in between can plan and manage their time, in
        advance. </p>
      <h4>Tips for scheduling </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Be explicit about the time commitment for&nbsp;all course related
          events.</li>
        <li>If the course event occurs online, remember there may be time zones
          that may affect the&nbsp;time for the online and/or in-person event.</li>
        <li>Create a course map that illustrates a timeline of online and
          offline content, interaction, and assessment elements required each
          week in your course.</li>
        <li>Look at your LMS and check to see&nbsp;what&nbsp;items with due
          dates do (or do not) appear in the LMS calendar.</li>
        <li>Describe the relationship between online activities and in class
          activities.</li>
        <li>Use iCal files (the standard internet calendar format) to create and
          share electronic calendars.</li>
      </ul>

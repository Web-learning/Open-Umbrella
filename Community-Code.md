Community Engagement

The open umbrella is intended to be a place for collaboration, support, ideas and thought around digital education.  While at present, the community of contributors is small. I hope that it will become a place and space that is welcoming of a diverse set of skills, capabilities and personalities. The open umbrella wishes to enable independent people, from all background and identities. I hope that this will be a place where we collaborate across the global ed tech community. Where we share feedback and experience with others. In a safe way, where we all are open, considerate and respectful.

When working with members in the open umbrella community, I think that we should strive to the following

1)  Being open and friendly

2)  Being considerate, patient and respectful

3)  Focusing on what is best for the community

4)  Being willing to appreciate differing view points

5)  Using welcoming and inclusive language

This community will not tolerate harassment in any form
